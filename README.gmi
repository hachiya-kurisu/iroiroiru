# iroiroiru

ever wonder whoâ€™s living quietly beside you?
tiny mushrooms tucked beneath leaves,
wildflowers whispering in the breeze,
beetles, birds, and beasts passing through unseen paths...

with free biodiversity data from gbif,
iroiroiru helps you uncover the secret lives all around you,
right here, right now.
